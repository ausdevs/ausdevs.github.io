This page is a compilation of *free* resources for people to use. The categories are taken from [neetcode](https://neetcode.io/practice) since we're currently (as of writing) following this study plan as a community.

## Recommended General Resources

- General:
    - [**Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis by Clifford A. Shaffer**](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~shaffer/Book/)
    - [**VisuAlgo**](https://visualgo.net/): A collection of DSA animated visualizations.
- More advanced:
    - [**Algorithms for Competitive Programming (cp-algorithms.com)**](https://cp-algorithms.com/)
    - [**CP1**](https://cpbook.net/details?cp=1)
    - [**CSES Competitive Programming Books List**](https://cses.fi/book/index.php)
        - *Competitive Programmer's Handbook* is on there, and is free to download a full PDF copy of.
    - [**systemic's blog**](https://www.seasalt.sh/words/index): A mix of content, but has plenty of DSA content to check out!
